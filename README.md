# Learning React

This repository was created to practice and learn the basics of React for frontend development. As a beginner, Iâ€™m using this project to explore how React works and get hands-on experience with its core features.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

This project helped me understand the following topics:

1. **React Components**  
   - Building simple and reusable functional components

2. **CSS Styling for Components and Page Handling**  
   - Applying inline styles, external CSS, and basic layout styling

3. **Creating Dynamic Components**  
   - Rendering components with data using `.map()` and conditional rendering

4. **Props Handling**  
   - Passing data between components using props

5. **React Router**  
   - Creating multiple pages and navigating between them using `react-router-dom`

6. **useState Hook**  
   - Managing and updating component-level state

7. **React Bootstrap**  
   - Using Bootstrap UI components for faster and responsive design

8. **Event Handling and useEffect Hook**  
   - Responding to user interactions  
   - Running side effects like API calls or time-based actions

ðŸ’¬ Notes

This is a beginner-friendly project focused on understanding core React concepts.

No backend or database is used.

Only frontend features are practiced here.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
